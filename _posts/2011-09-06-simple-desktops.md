I'm pumped to finally share what I've been working on for the Mac: [Simple Desktops][appstore].

This handy little app can change your desktop background automatically or on-demand, and it pulls
all of it's content from [SimpleDesktops.com][website], impeccably curated by Tom Watson.

Big props go out to [Greg Aker][gaker] for server monkeying and Louis Harboe for the smashing icon.

Buy it, rate it, tell your friends, <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">email me</a> with any feedback.
