[Jason Kottke][kottke] posts a semi-regular [recap of his "media diet,"][kottke-media-diet] which I always find interesting. He only writes one or two sentences about each item, and gives them a letter grade, which I think is a great length: I don't [tweet][my-twitter] that much, and Twitter doesn't need my hot takes in real-time anyway, but I do think it's fun to write this stuff down to revisit later.

Here's what I've been reading and watching this January.

[His Dark Materials](https://www.hbo.com/his-dark-materials) on HBO. I'd been curious about this story since the 2007 movie, but never took the time to read the books. This really well-done and inspred me to finally read the series.

[Watchmen](https://www.hbo.com/watchmen) on HBO. This was so, so good. Every episode made me say two things: "WTF did I just watch?" and "I cannot wait until the next episode." We truly live in the golden age of TV. 

[The Golden Compass](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC1ICM/), [The Subtle Knife](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC1KJS/), and [The Amber Spyglass](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FC1GJW/) by Philip Pullman. After watching the HBO show, I couldn't wait for the next season so I went ahead and read all three books. These were a great read, but now I have no idea how they're going to film these next two books without spending hundreds of millions of dollars.

[For All Mankind](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/for-all-mankind/umc.cmc.6wsi780sz5tdbqcf11k76mkp7). I'm a sucker for both space exploration and alternate histories, so this was a no-brainer for me. Fun, although it gets slow in a few places. Looking forward to season 2.

[The Witcher](https://www.netflix.com/title/80189685) on Netflix. I never played the games---and didn't realize the games were based on books---but enjoyed this more than I expected. The "Toss A Coin To Your Witcher" song is just as catchy as everyone says.

[Ra](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L9KLYPK/) by Sam Hughes. The premise is fascinating ("What if magic was discovered in the 1970s and was treated as a rigorous science?") but gets into "hard" sci-fi territory, which I find kind of tedious. I finished it but would find it hard to recommend unless you like that particluar style.

[The Last Wish: Introducing the Witcher](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010SIPT4/) by Andrzej Sapkowski. Again, watched the show, didn't want to wait for a new season, so now I'm working through the books. I haven't finished this yet (only about halfway through) but it's been just as enjoyable as the show and I'll probably keep reading in the series.
