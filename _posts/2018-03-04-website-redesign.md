After what I think must be about six years of the current design, I finally made some updates around here and refreshed my look. Spending time on a redesign instead actually, you know, _writing_ is such a clich&#233;, but here we are.

<div class="blockimage">
<img width="2460" height="1756"
  src="/static/post_assets/2018-03-04-website-redesign/2018-redesign-homepage.png"
  alt="A screenshot of the new homepage after the redesign."
  title="" />
</div>

I also took this chance to make the design a bit more complex while staying responsive, which would have been way harder without the use of [CSS flexbox][flexbox], which made this surprisingly easy.

I also borrowed some really handy design tips from this great article, _[7 Practical Tips for Cheating at Design][design]_. I think my last design definitely committed a few of the sins they recommend against in the article.

Anyway, watch out for wet paint or layout bugs while the new design settles in.
