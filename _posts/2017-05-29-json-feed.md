Since all the cool kids are doing it, I've added <a href="/feed.json">a JSON Feed for my website</a>.

Adding this to Jekyll wasn't too bad (you can see <a href="https://github.com/Vossy/justinvoss.com/commit/39f0f6942e9266d349806e5faffd9c13b95ea197">the Git commit</a> for yourself), although I did have to learn some new Liquid template tricks, like using the `jsonify` filter, the `unless` tag, and the `forloop` object.

I don't know if JSON Feed is going to take off in a big way or not, but it was fun to implement. Check out <a href="https://jsonfeed.org">the spec</a> if you're interested in adding it to your project.
