Like all of you, I've spent the last few weeks almost exclusively at home, waiting for the virus to blow over. I've unfortunately spent most of my non-work time obsessively checking the news and social media instead of learning to bake sourdough or write the next great American novel, but that doesn't mean I have *nothing* to report for my "media diet" log.

Here's what I've been reading and watching before and during the social isolation age.

[Annihilation](https://letterboxd.com/film/annihilation/). Finally got around to watching this after owning it on iTunes forever. A decent movie, but somehow didn't fully capture the profound *weirdness* of the book.

[Below Deck Sailing Yacht](https://www.bravotv.com/below-deck-sailing-yacht). A total guilty pleasure that I make no apology for.

[Elantris](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003G93YLY) by Brandon Sanderson. I think this was Sanderson's first Cosmere novel, and it lays out the pattern that other books would build on. Great read.

[Upgrade](https://letterboxd.com/film/upgrade/). A fun, but dark, indie sci-fi.

[Detective Pikachu](https://letterboxd.com/film/pokemon-detective-pikachu/). More enjoyable than I honestly expected. Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu shouldn't work as well as it does.

[Cloverfield](https://letterboxd.com/film/cloverfield/). I don't think I'd re-watched this since it originally came out, and I had totally forgotten that T.J. Miller is the "cameraman" for most of the movie.

[Psych](https://www.usanetwork.com/psych). A "comfort food" TV show, perfect for rewatching during a global crisis.

[Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle](https://letterboxd.com/film/jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle/). I saw this in the theater when it came out, and my expectations were low: but it was fun! Rewatching it reminded me that I should watch [the sequel](https://letterboxd.com/film/jumanji-the-next-level/).

[Back to the Future](https://letterboxd.com/film/back-to-the-future/). We recently set up a surround-sound system at home using some Sonos speakers, so I put this on as a "test," which was a smashing success.

[The Lies of Locke Lamora](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMKNJ2) by Scott Lynch. An exciting heist story in a truly strange sci-fi / fantasy setting. Looking forward to reading the next in the series.

[Batman Begins](https://letterboxd.com/film/batman-begins/). Another movie to "test" the surround-sound; I didn't think I'd be so into the home theater setup as I am, but now I don't think I can go back to my old stereo life.
